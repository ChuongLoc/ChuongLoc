As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there are several excellent books on Natural Language Processing (NLP) that provide comprehensive coverage of the field. Keep in mind that new books may have been published since then. Here are some highly recommended NLP books:

"Speech and Language Processing" by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin:

This is a widely used textbook that covers both speech and language processing. It's suitable for beginners and provides a good foundation for understanding key NLP concepts.
"Natural Language Processing in Action" by Lane, Howard, and Hapke:

This book is practical and hands-on, making it a great choice for those who want to learn NLP through coding examples and real-world applications. It uses the Python programming language.
"Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing" by Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze:

This classic book provides a solid introduction to the statistical and mathematical foundations of NLP. It covers a range of topics from basic to advanced.
"Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin:

This book is widely used in academia and industry. It covers a broad spectrum of topics in NLP and computational linguistics.
"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper:

This book, often referred to as the NLTK book, is a practical guide to NLP using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. It's suitable for beginners and covers various NLP tasks.
"Speech and Language Processing: A Guide to Theory, Algorithm and System Development" by John G. Proakis and Dimitris K. Manolakis:

This book focuses on the processing of both speech and language, providing a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications.
"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" by Palash Goyal, Sumit Pandey, and Karan Jain:

If you're interested in the intersection of deep learning and NLP, this book is a good choice. It covers deep learning techniques for various NLP tasks.
Remember to check for newer editions or additional resources that may have been published since my last update. The field of NLP is rapidly evolving, and staying up-to-date with the latest literature is essential.
